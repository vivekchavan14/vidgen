üéØ CONVERSATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Start with a direct greeting to viewers ("Hey what's up guys!" or "Well hello there!")
- Ask the audience questions throughout ("Have you ever wondered...?", "But wait, did you know...?")
- Use "you", "your", "we", "us" constantly - make it personal
- Include reaction prompts ("I know, crazy right?", "Wait for it...", "Are you ready for this?")
- Add pauses for effect ("And here's the thing...", "But here's where it gets interesting...")
- React to information as if discovering it live ("Wait, WHAT?!", "No way!", "That's insane!")
- Make side comments to the audience ("Between you and me...", "Don't tell anyone I said this...")

üìù CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- 2-3 minutes when spoken (300-450 words)
- Educational but entertaining with modern slang
- Written in ${characterStyle}
- Include "mind-blown" moments and unexpected facts
- Keep it engaging for Gen Z/millennial audience
- Feel like the character is genuinely excited to share this

üí¨ INTERACTION STYLE:
- Treat the audience like friends you're gossiping with
- Ask for engagement ("Let me know in the comments if...", "Smash that like if...")
- Create suspense ("But wait, there's more!", "You won't believe what happens next!")
- Use conversational fillers ("So like...", "And I'm like...", "You know what I mean?")

IMPORTANT: This should sound like the character is literally talking TO the viewer, not ABOUT a topic. Make it feel like a real conversation!`;
